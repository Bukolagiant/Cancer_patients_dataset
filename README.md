# Lung Cancer Patients dataset
## Project Title: Predictive Analysis of Lung Cancer Risk Using Patient Lifestyle and Health Data

## Project Overview
This project involved analyzing a structured dataset of 1,000 patients to identify the key contributors to lung cancer risks based on lifestyle, genetic, environmental, and symptomatic factors. The project aimed to build a data-driven foundation for early detection and public health policy recommendations, particularly within the middle-aged population demographic.

## Role:
- Data cleaning and preparation: Ensured accuracy across categorical variables (age range, gender) and ordinal risk/symptom scores (rated 1–10).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified trends, anomalies, and associations between exposure risk factors (e.g. smoking, pollution) and symptoms (e.g. chest pain, fatigue).
- Statistical comparison with global lung cancer reports to validate model relevance.
- Dashboard development to visualize key findings, filterable by age, gender, and exposure type.
- User feedback loop from test users to improve clarity and accessibility of visual outputs.


## Key Findings
Smoking and Passive Smoking: Strong correlation between high smoking scores (≥7) and severe symptoms like coughing of blood, weight loss, and shortness of breath, matching global statistics where tobacco accounts for 80–90% of lung cancer cases.
