# Lung Cancer Patients Analysis
## Project Title: Predictive Analysis of Lung Cancer Risk Using Patient Lifestyle and Health Data

## Project Overview
This project involved analyzing a structured dataset of 1,000 patients to identify the key contributors to lung cancer risks based on lifestyle, genetic, environmental, and symptomatic factors. The project aimed to build a data-driven foundation for early detection and public health policy recommendations, particularly within the middle-aged population demographic.

## Role:
- Data cleaning and preparation: Ensured accuracy across categorical variables (age range, gender) and ordinal risk/symptom scores (rated 1–10).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified trends, anomalies, and associations between exposure risk factors (e.g. smoking, pollution) and symptoms (e.g. chest pain, fatigue).
- Statistical comparison with global lung cancer reports to validate model relevance.
- Dashboard development to visualize key findings, filterable by age, gender, and exposure type.
- User feedback loop from test users to improve clarity and accessibility of visual outputs.

#### Smoking and Passive Smoking: 
Strong correlation between high smoking scores (≥7) and severe symptoms like coughing of blood, weight loss, and shortness of breath, matching global statistics where tobacco accounts for 80–90% of lung cancer cases.
Environmental Exposure: Patients with high air pollution and occupational hazard scores showed similar symptom severity—even among non-smokers, indicating air quality is a critical risk contributor.

#### Gender Differences: 
Male patients made up a large portion of the dataset, with consistently higher exposure to dust, smoking and alcohol use. However, female patients—even in lower numbers-displayed significant symptoms when passive smoker or genetic risk values were high, supporting emerging international evidence about non-smoking female susceptibility.

#### Age Factor: 
All patients were middle-aged (around 28–44 years), but symptom escalation patterns suggest early warning signs can manifest well before the traditional lung cancer diagnosis age of 65+.

#### Lifestyle Factors: 
Poor balanced diet and high alcohol use also correlated with symptom severity, albeit to a lesser extent than environmental and genetic risk factors.

### Tools & Technologies Used:
Microsoft Excel and Power Query – Data wrangling and normalization

Power BI – Visual dashboard for interactive reporting

SQL Server Import Wizard – Initial data staging


### Validation Against International Reports
The analysis was benchmarked against peer-reviewed medical studies and global health sources including:

WHO Global Cancer Observatory

American Cancer Society

CDC Lung Cancer Reports

National Institutes of Health (NIH)


### The project confirmed:

Global alignment with smoking and passive exposure trends

Environmental and occupational risk as under-recognized contributors

Increased risk in non-smoking women due to genetic and secondary exposure factors


### Conclusion
This project analysed that middle-aged individuals (20–45) are at a higher risk of getting lung cancer, mostly because of health risk factors like smoking and environmental factors. Workplace factors/hazards also contribute greatly to contracting lung cancer. Men seem to be more exposed to these risk factors that cause lung cancer. The risks associated with smoking should be greatly aired, with the main target audience being men, as well as passive smokers. Likewise, workplaces should be safe, and everything that could contribute to the risk should be prevented. In conclusion, people should be educated about the risk factors of lung cancer, early diagnosis and prevention.
